# Four-cups
## A journey Of Print("Hello World") to Real Application(Four-Cups game)
As a Beginner,applying the concepts learned in class on a real life application is the Biggest deal to me.After Brainstorming I remembered A Game-"FOUR CUPS" which been our best childhood memory.And what if the the game which we used to play with paper is converted into some sequence of code...And this what I done in this project. </br>
</br>
Code Description</br></br>

>Step-1:- At First I initialised a list with 4 colours-That is the same thing we do ,like we randomly write colours on top of the 4-Cups.</br>
>Step-2:-In next step I asked the user to select a color-As we ask same thing when we play with paper 4-cups.</br>
>step-3:-Based On the input color I used conditional statments to write logic,In between logic I asked the user to select a number by providing the choices to user.</br>
</br>
After taking all  the inputs from user it displays A message which is the final output of the program.
</br>
</br>
The sequence of code is only written by using "Conditional statements" a topic of PYTHON(Core).Not only Conditional Statemts,it covers 30% of topics in PYTHON(Core),like </br>--initialising value to variable </br>--data types</br>--data structures</br>--All IF-conditions including nested If's</br>
